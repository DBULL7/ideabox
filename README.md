# idealist is a project from the Turing school to learn Persistence through local storage techniques as well as document searching

### We were also challenged to have responsive CSS and ARIA accessibility labels.

### idealist takes an idea from a user, allows the user to edit it after it's been generated and updates the edits to local storage. It also allows users to search all their ideas and hide ideas that don't match. Users can also rate the quality of their ideas through "upvote and downvote buttons".
